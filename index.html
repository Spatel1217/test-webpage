            I am currently a student at Macalester College on track to be a Computer Science and Psychology major
            with a minor in Japanese. When I am not studying or reviewing for my classes, you can find me at
            extracurricular events, working on small projects, or just taking some time for myself.
        </p>

            This Summer I am taking online courses from Harvard, working on a few personal projects, and catching up on
            reading. Feel free to contact me at any time using any of the links below.
